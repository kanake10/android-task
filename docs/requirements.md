Hello dear Android dev prospect!

This repository is supposed to act as a playground for your submission.
Before getting started, please make sure to clone this repository on which you will commit and push your code regularly. Once you are ready, please mail us back the link to your repository.

Below, you will find the **Task** definition. Happy Hacking :computer: and Good Luck :shamrock:

# Task

Write an Android application that connects to a remote API, downloads a certain set of resources, shows them in a list and provides some basic searching/filtering feature-set.
In particular, the app should:

- Request the resources located at `https://api.baubuddy.de/dev/index.php/v1/tasks/select`
- Store them in an appropriate data structure that allows using the application offline
- Display all items in a list showing `task`, `title`, `description` and `colorCode` (which should be a view colored according to `colorCode`)
- The app should offer a search menu item (search bar not a separate screen) that allows searching for any of the class properties (even those, that are not visible to the user directly)
- The app should offer a menu item that allows scanning for QR-Codes
    - Upon successful scan, the search query should be set to the scanned text
- In order to refresh the data, the app should offer:
    - a swipe-2-refresh functionality
    - and a worker that requests the resources from above every 60 minutes

### Authorization

It's mandatory for your requests towers the API to be authorized. You can find the required request below:

This is how it looks in `curl`:

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.baubuddy.de/index.php/login \
  --header 'Authorization: Basic QVBJX0V4cGxvcmVyOjEyMzQ1NmlzQUxhbWVQYXNz' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
        "username":"365",
        "password":"1"
}'
```

The response will contain a json object, having the access token in `json["oauth"]["access_token"]`. For all subsequent calls this has to be added to the request headers as `Authorization: Bearer {access_token}`.

A possible implementation in `Kotlin` could be the following. You don't have to copy over this one, feel free to indivualize it or use a different network library.

```kotlin
val client = OkHttpClient()
val mediaType = MediaType.parse("application/json")
val body = RequestBody.create(mediaType, "{\n        \"username\":\"365\",\n        \"password\":\"1\"\n}")
val request = Request.Builder()
  .url("https://api.baubuddy.de/index.php/login")
  .post(body)
  .addHeader("Authorization", "Basic QVBJX0V4cGxvcmVyOjEyMzQ1NmlzQUxhbWVQYXNz")
  .addHeader("Content-Type", "application/json")
  .build()
val response = client.newCall(request).execute()
```
