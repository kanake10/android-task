# üõ†Ô∏è Task App

This Android application connects to a remote API to fetch a list of tasks, stores them locally for offline access and presents them in a user-friendly, searchable UI. It also provides QR code scanning and periodic background updates to ensure the data stays fresh.

You can read more about the [requirements needed here](https://github.com/kanake10/android-task/blob/master/docs/requirements.md).
## üéØ Objective

The goal of this app is to:

- Connect to the [BauBuddy API](https://api.baubuddy.de/dev/index.php/v1/tasks/select) with proper authentication.
- Fetch and display a list of tasks.
- Store data locally for offline usage.
- Allow users to search tasks by any of their properties.
- Scan QR codes to initiate a search.
- Keep data up-to-date using pull-to-refresh and background syncing.

## ‚úÖ Features Implemented

- **Authentication** with OAuth2 using a login POST request and Bearer token authorization for subsequent API requests.
- **Fetch tasks** from a secured remote API.
- **Local storage** of fetched data for offline availability.
- **List view** to display:
  - Task name
  - Title
  - Description
  - A color block representing the `colorCode` property.
- **Search bar** in the menu:
  - Filters tasks by any property (even non-visible ones).
- **QR Code scanning**:
  - Automatically sets the scanned text as the current search query.
- **Swipe-to-refresh** to manually reload the data.
- **Background worker** that syncs tasks from the server every 60 minutes.

## üß™ Testing Approach

This project uses a layered and modular testing strategy to ensure reliability, correctness and maintainability across the app‚Äôs architecture. Here‚Äôs how different components are tested:

- **ViewModels**  
  Tested in isolation using **fake repositories** and **JUnit** for assertions. This ensures business logic and state management behave as expected.

- **Repositories**  
  **MockK** is used to mock dependencies and test repository logic independently of data sources.

- **DAO Layer**  
  **Robolectric** enables running Room database tests directly on the JVM, ensuring fast and reliable database testing without the need for an emulator or device.

- **API Layer**  
  **MockWebServer** simulates API responses, allowing for testing Retrofit service interfaces and network behavior without hitting the real API.

- **UI Components (Jetpack Compose)**  
  UI elements such as the **Search Bar**, **Top App Bar**, and **Task List Item** are tested using `ComposeTestRule` to validate their behavior, state changes and interaction flows.

## üì≤ UI Automation with Maestro

To enhance UI reliability and simulate real-world usage scenarios, this project uses [**Maestro**](https://maestro.mobile.dev/) for end-to-end testing.

Two YAML-based flow tests are included under the `.maestro/` directory:

1. **Offline Test:**  
   **File:** `.maestro/task_app_offline.yaml`  
   - Simulates app launch with Airplane Mode **enabled**.  
   - Verifies appropriate error messages are shown and that no task data is loaded.

2. **Online Test:**  
   **File:** `.maestro/task_app_flow.yaml`  
   - Simulates normal app behavior with internet access.  
   - Validates UI interactions such as:
     - Viewing and filtering task lists

NB: I need to research whether there is a way to streamline this with a single test suite if Maestro gains support for toggling connectivity states.
